# scattering-codes


Scripts to run MSE and moving MSE (MMSE) analysis on time series. Calculations are completed using matlab scripts but some of the preprocessing uses Python (could be re-written into Matlab in the future for ease). Shell scripts are included which run the entire download, preprocessing and main analysis in one go.
